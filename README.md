Geometric Brownian Motion Simulation
This code performs a simulation of Geometric Brownian Motion using the Monte Carlo method. It generates multiple stock price trajectories based on the given parameters and plots the results.

Requirements
Python 3.x
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
Installation
Clone the repository or download the code files.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
Usage
Open the code file in a Python editor or IDE.

Modify the parameters as desired:

mu: drift coefficient
n: number of steps
T: time in years
M: number of simulations
S0: initial stock price
sigma: volatility
Run the code to generate the Geometric Brownian Motion simulation.

The code will produce a plot showing the stock price trajectories.


Geometric Brownian Motion Plot

The plot displays multiple realizations of the stock price following the Geometric Brownian Motion model.
